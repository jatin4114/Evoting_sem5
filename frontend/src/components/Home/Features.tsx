              Immutability means something that canâ€™t be changed or altered.
              This is one of the top blockchain features that help to ensure
              that the technology will remain as it is, a permanent, unalterable
              network.

            <p>
            Blockchain relies on cryptographic techniques to secure transactions. 
            Each user has a private key to sign their vote, and the public key is used to
            verify the authenticity of the vote. This cryptographic layer adds an extra level
             of security to the e-voting process.

            <p>
            A decentralized blockchain is a distributed and tamper-resistant digital 
            ledger that records transactions across a network of computers, removing 
            the need for a central authority and promoting security, transparency, and 
            censorship resistance.

            <p>
            A distributed ledger blockchain is a decentralized, transparent, and secure digital
             record-keeping system that utilizes a network of computers to maintain a shared database
              of transactions, ensuring immutability and eliminating the need for a central authority.
